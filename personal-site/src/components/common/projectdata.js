        longd: "the origin of eye explore comes from yet another hackathon. a trip downtown, countless of red bulls and no sleep for 36 hours was definitely an experience… despite EyeExplore’s lack of accolades, it does hold a precious place in my heart! \nlet’s start with the very beginning, ideation! our group, formed from fellow western founders networkers peers, was heavily inspired by the kdrama, start up. i remember the initial jumps of excitement as we got to brainstorming. (shoutout to uoft’s very nice whiteboards!) \n my main objective this hackathon was prioritizing ux over ui. i think it was a fun challenge as someone who likes a pretty mockup. in some ways, i felt as if it was a testament to my growth as an individual as i found myself directly applying feedback received from previous hackathons. \n react native… i think i’ve formed a love-hate relationship with this library after uoft hacks. it was my first time using it, and through following a tutorial, i made the choice to use expo instead. (i still don’t know if that’s valid). nevertheless, i definitely enjoyed playing around with the different extra libraries (i.e react native’s cameras!) you don’t understand how happy i was to make the camera work. it was overall a fun experience even if we didn’t win this time!",
